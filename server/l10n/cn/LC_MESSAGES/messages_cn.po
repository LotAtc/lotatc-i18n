msgid "LotAtc 4 DCS is a software that allows you to simulate the role of an air traffic controller (namely, first, an Air Defense controller). LotAtc shows the tactical situation (aircraft, SAMs, boats) on a 'radar screen' with a map background. As a virtual controller, you will be able to guide human virtual pilots in DCS World multiplayer missions, by radioing them (through your regular voice software such as Teamspeak, Mumble ... etc), whether to make them find their way and/or their leader, set up to your fighters to intercept bandits, or press the muds to hide or take shelter given what happens in front of them."
msgstr "LotAtc 4 DCS是一款用于模拟空管的软件。LotAtc通过自身的\"雷达屏幕\"展示了相关地图的战术态势（航空器、地空导弹、舰艇等）。作为一名虚拟管控员，玩家将可以通过语音软件指挥引导DCS World多人联机里的其他玩家（例如导航、截击等任务）。"
